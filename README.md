# Jeff Edson's Homework Repo

---

Hi, I'm Jeff, and I found savvy coders looking for apprenticeships and internships. I was struggling to find opportunites without much in the way of a portfolio, so Savvy Coders was the perfect opportunity to get me up to speed through plenty of practice.

I have worked IT before, but my most recent experiences are in healthcare and non-profit. I've chosen very diverse jobs in the past because I love learning new things, and that is really why I've chosen programming because it is a career path that will keep me learning something new every day.

My goals for this bootcamp:
- Build a coding portfolio.
- Improve and refresh my web development skills.
- Make connections and find employment opportunities.
